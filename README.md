# QR_Code_Gen_JS_1.0
# Web-Based QR Code Generator

This is a simple and responsive web application that allows users to generate QR codes for any text or URL they input. The project is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes an API to create and fetch the generated QR codes. It is designed to work seamlessly across both mobile and desktop devices.

## Features

- Built with basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Uses an **API** to generate and fetch the QR code.
- Fully **responsive design** for mobile and desktop devices.
  
## What I Learned

1. How to integrate third-party **APIs** into a web project.
2. Improved my skills in making web applications **responsive** across different devices.
3. Gained better understanding of **JavaScript** for dynamic content generation.

## Future Scope

1. **Offline QR Code generation**: Implement a feature to generate QR codes without the need for an external API.
2. **Customizable QR Codes**: Allow users to change the color, size, and design of the generated QR codes.
3. **QR Code History**: Add a feature to save and manage previously generated QR codes for easy access.

## How to Use

1. Enter the text or URL in the input field.
2. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
3. The QR code will be displayed, which can be downloaded(by right clicking only, for now).
